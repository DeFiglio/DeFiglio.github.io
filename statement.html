<h1> Artist Statement</h1>

<p>
	My name is Olivia DeFiglio, I’m an art historian who’s passionate about the field of aesthetics-specifically abstract, expressionism, art deco, contemporary and architectural works. Since I was young, I’ve always had a strong adoration for design and visual forms and it was obvious to me that I would have a future in art. In the past, I created my own work, mostly through charcoal, pen and ink and graphite-making both realistic and distorted imagery. After years in the practice of drawing, I decided to veer in the direction of studying art instead of making it.  Throughout my education in art history, I have continued to find an array of works that speak to me and heighten my interest in this industry. I’ve come across diverse mediums such as photographs, textiles, prints, digital media, paint and even food that captured my attention and have granted me the ability to expand my knowledge of what makes a piece of art. For the past few months I've been experimenting with Digital Media art, this webpage is a platform for the work that I've done so far with Processing,Sublime coding, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Meshmixer, Sketchfab, and video editing. <br><br>More recently, I presented my writing at an undergraduate symposium at the De Young Museum in San Francisco. During this event, I introduced Kara Walker’s piece, A Subtlety or the Marvelous Sugar Baby, and connected it to Michael Shanks archeological essay, “The Life of an Artifact”. Linking Walker’s piece to Shanks essay was integral in portraying the complexities and depth that A Subtlety contains. The physical aspects of the piece are made up of a giant 75 ft. long and 35 ft. tall, white, sugar sculpture of a woman with dangerously stereotypical black features, shown in a position similar to that of the Egyptian Sphinx. She is displayed naked, with large breasts that confront the viewer and from the back you can see her bare backside. This large sculpture is accompanied by about 15 smaller molasses sculptures of child slaves. These components all point to the inequality and racism that were apart of the despicable construct of slavery.<br><br>
	A Subtlety was a temporary sculpture that comments on racism, the unearthing of the sugar industry, accessibility of female slaves, the exploitation of labor and the many atrocities that encompass them. The composition was displayed in a space that was previously used for sugar processing, further speaking to the piece. I was passionate about this presentation because it allowed me to learn about various areas of racism and also to advocate for those who have been silenced out of fear and abuse of power. After being apart of this symposium and going through the editing process, I realized that my interests lie in compositions and works that contain greater meaning and work to bring justice. For my future in art history, I hope to apply myself to these standards and be apart of a community that aspires to establish change through art.
